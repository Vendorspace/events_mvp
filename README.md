# Vendorspace MERN MVP

## What is Vendorspace?
Vendorspace is an event planning app for vendors, venues, and event planners. Think Airbnb for music festivals, conferences, and other event that require professional planning. Vendorspace is based in the Atlanta Tech Village in (yes, that's right) Atlanta, Georgia.

## What is this MVP?

The current MVP (http://demo.vendorspace.co/) is powered by Wordpress and will provide users and potential investors with a sense of Vendorspace's capabilities. The MERN app in this repository will replace the Wordpress app as the number of users increases.

## Tests
We're using jest and enzyme.
